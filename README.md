# PlaylistColab
The project is a web-based application that allows users to create and manage playlists, add songs to playlists, and integrate with Spotify and YouTube. The application uses a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to provide a seamless user experience.

On the front-end, the application uses Angular to render a dynamic and responsive user interface. The user can log in, sign up, and interact with the application using various buttons, forms, and menus.

On the back-end, the application uses the Java programming language and the Spring Framework to define a set of RESTful APIs that provide access to the application's core functionalities. The APIs are secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and can be accessed by authorized clients using HTTP requests and responses.

The application's core functionalities are implemented using a set of service classes that handle tasks such as user authentication and authorization, user management, playlist management, and YouTube integration. These services use a variety of data access objects (DAOs), such as repositories and data access objects (DAOs), to interact with the application's data store and external services, such as Spotify and YouTube.
